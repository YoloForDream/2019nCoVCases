# 2019nCoVCases
This is a python script mainly used to crawl the 2019nCoV global infection data. It can help you generate reports in excel format. The data is from JHU university.
I hope the spread of the virus will be controlled soon
I hope those who have been infected will recover as soon as possible
I hope those who lost loved ones to this virus can be strong
God bless
